# Windows Usage
SolarThing works on Windows, but there's some configuration that you will have to figure out
for yourself.

You will notice in the documentation on here you constantly run `*.sh` files. Windows does not natively support
running `*.sh` files. However, you may be able to get away with running them using Git Bash, which
you likely have installed if you installed Git at https://gitforwindows.org.

If you are able to get Git Bash working on windows, you can leave out the `sudo` on all the commands, as it will have no effect.

Note that SolarThing is not tested on Windows. If you have issues, please report them on [our issues page](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing/issues).

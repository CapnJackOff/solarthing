# Legacy
This folder contains legacy code that probably never be used again

### [helloworld.pl](helloworld.pl)
This is the first program that got data from our Outback Mate. It was written in perl, which is
not the most beautiful thing in the world.

### [schema-generator](schema-generator)
The purpose of this was to generate a JSON schema for the SolarThing packets. This may be used again,
but for now GraphQL SPQR gets the job done schema-wise.

### [json-datasource](json-datasource)
Its [readme](json-datasource/README.md) describes its purpose pretty well.
